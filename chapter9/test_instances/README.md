# Test instances for min cost flow.
the output of "inputN.txt" is "outputN.txt" for N = 1,2,..

## input format
```
(the number of vertices) (the number of edges) (the flow value)
(sorce) (sink)
(tale of edge1) (head of edge1) (capacity of edge1) (cost of edge1)
(tale of edge2) (head of edge2) (capacity of edge2) (cost of edge2)
(tale of edge3) (head of edge3) (capacity of edge3) (cost of edge3)
(tale of edge4) (head of edge4) (capacity of edge4) (cost of edge4)
...

## output format
```
(min cost value)
```
